<h2 align="center">✦ Overview ✦ </h2>

#### A shell built to get things done.

Key goals:
- Prefer Usability
- Composable modules, design and appearance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * If you want to access the older releases refer to the [archive branch](https://github.com/nucleus-hq/nucleus-shell/tree/archive)
> * You can also join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/FcvT2VabEM) for help.
> * **Before reporting an issue:**
  If you encounter a problem in the current release, please first test against the latest source code by cloning the repository (`git clone ...`). This ensures you are not reporting an issue that has already been fixed.
  Only open an issue if the problem is still reproducible on the latest source.

> [!CAUTION]
> * You will find a lot of design and ui inconsistencies with the latest git clone because it is under development. Prefer using the latest release rather than the latest clone.

<h2 align="center">✦ Repository layout ✦</h2>


- /quickshell/     — Primary shell
- /license/        — License and contributing docs
- /previews/       — Example screenshots used in this README
- /install/          — Installer scripts and bootstrap utilities

<h2 align="center">✦ Installation ✦</h2>


Follow these steps to install the shell. The automated setup is conservative and will prompt before making destructive changes.

### Using the cli
```
yay -S nucleus-shell
nucleus install
```

### Using the install script
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nucleus-hq/nucleus-shell
cd nucleus-shell/install
./unified.sh
```
Notes:
- Manual installation (symlinking files yourself) is supported and recommended for cautious users.
- Install Script is preffered over the cli installation. 
- Back up your existing dotfiles (e.g. ~/.config/ ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile) before running the bootstrap.

---

<h2 align="center">✦ Configuration &amp; customization ✦</h2>

- Primary config: `~/.config/nucleus-shell/config/configuration.json`
- Modular settings: prompt, completion, and widget modules are separated for easy replacement.
- To customize:
  - Edit the primary config or use the provided settings app.
  - Enable/disable modules by editing the module list in the `~/.config/quickshell/nucleus-shell/shell.qml` file.

<h2 align="center">✦ Troubleshooting ✦</h2>

- Missing/Unloaded Modules:
  - Ensure the module file is loaded in the correct order. Check `~/.config/quickshell/nucleus-shell/shell.qml`.
- Broken visuals:
  - Check `~/.local/share/nucleus/user/config.json`
- Slow startup:
  - Disable unused modules or lazy-load heavy features (e.g., prompt segments that query network/state).
- Conflicting user configs:
  - Inspect existing profile files (`~/.bashrc`, `~.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, `~/.config`) before applying changes.
- Installer failures:
  - Re-run the installer with verbose output or check `install/` scripts for dependency checks.
- Cli Commands
  - To update: `nucleus update` The cli will guide you through the update.
  - To uninstall: `nucleus uninstall` The cli will automaticly uninstall the shell.
  - To stop/kill the shell: `nucleus kill` or `nucleus stop`
  - To switch themes: `nucleus switch theme <themename>`
