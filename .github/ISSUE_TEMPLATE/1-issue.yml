        - NOTE 2: If your problem is distro specific and you do not use Arch(-based) distros, please submit [Discussion at Extra Distros](https://github.com/xZepyx/nucleus-shell/discussions/new?category=extra-distros) instead.

        **Tips for the following Step 3**
        1. Use `LANG=C LC_ALL=C` to get the output of a command in English, eg. `LANG=C LC_ALL=C date` displays time in English.
        2. If it throws errors, **PLEASE**, attach logs and describe in detail if possible.
           - Bar and widgets not showing? run `pkill quickshell; quickshell -c ae-qs` for logs.
           - Installation failed? Run installation again for logs.
           - You may use more code blocks when needed.
        3. In case you are confused, the `<details>`, `<summary>`, `</summary>`, `</details>` are HTML tags for folding the logs (typically very long) inside. Please do not touch them (unless you know what you are doing).
        4. If the logs are suuuuuuper long, consider using an online pastebin service instead.
