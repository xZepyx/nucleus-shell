## Code Style

* Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
* Keep configuration files modular and readable.
* Comment non-obvious code.
* Use `Metrics.function(value)` for spacing, margin, radius, and duration (except timers). [See Metrics docs](../shell/config/Metrics.md).
* Prefer module loaders for modules with enable/disable config values to prevent crashes and reduce RAM usage.

# Collaborator Workflow

> [!CAUTION]
> Direct pushes to `main` are prohibited. All work must be done in feature branches.

## 1. Branch Naming

Format:

```
collaborator/<username>/<type>/<short-description>
```

| Segment               | Description                 | Example                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `collaborator`        | Always present              | collaborator                  |
| `<username>`          | GitHub username             | alice                         |
| `<type>`              | Type of work                | feat, chore, improvement, fix |
| `<short-description>` | 1–2 word summary of changes | settings-ui, typo-fix         |

**Examples:**

```
collaborator/alice/feat/settings-ui
collaborator/bob/fix/sidebar-color
collaborator/john/improvement/color-gen
```

---

## 2. Local Setup (First Time)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:xZepyx/nucleus-shell.git
cd nucleus-shell
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

---

## 3. Creating a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b collaborator/<username>/<type>/<short-description>
```

**Example:**

```bash
git checkout -b collaborator/alice/feat/settings-ui
```

---

## 4. Work and Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add UI for settings panel"
```

---

## 5. Push Your Branch

```bash
git push origin collaborator/<username>/<type>/<short-description>
```

**Example:**

```bash
git push origin collaborator/alice/feat/settings-ui
```

---

## 6. Open a Pull Request

1. Go to GitHub and click **Compare & pull request**.
2. Ensure the base branch is `main`.
3. Submit for review.

> ❌ Do not merge your own PR.

---

## 7. Branch Cleanup

After your PR is merged:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d collaborator/<username>/<type>/<short-description>
git fetch --prune
```

GitHub may auto-delete the remote branch if enabled.

---

## 8. Keeping Your Branch Updated (Optional)

```bash
git checkout collaborator/<username>/<type>/<short-description>
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

> Resolve conflicts and push updates before modifying the PR.
